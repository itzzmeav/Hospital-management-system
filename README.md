# Hospital-management-system
The first software project management activity is the determination of software scope. The Hospital Management System would be developed for the Shri Ayurveda clinic to overcome the problems faced by Hospital staffs of recording daily patient & employ record of Hospital.
Information Objective for the Clients:
The senior officers have been given privilege to view reports in pre-determined format approved by the principal.                                                                                                
         Report on add employ list.
         Report on add patient list.
         Report on View employ list.
         Report on view each patient.
For all the above reports to be generated the users would have to enter the following data through user-friendly forms.
            Data regarding details of all the patient.
            Data regarding details of all the patient & employ.
            Data regarding all the user name and their userid.
4.1 Overall Description of the Project:
The "Hospital Management System" would be developed to overcome the problems faced by Hospital staffs of recording daily details which comes under the Management. This system would act as a unified Central Repository system where all the data related to the product may be stored & accessed from computer in LAN & by all the authorized personals.

The various modules in this project would be:
DATABASE DESIGNING: This involves designing the relational schema of the database to be used. Various tables to be used, their attributes, Primary and Foreign keys, relationship between various tables, constraints on the attributes, and all other such related tasks fall under this module. This module is the core of the entire project and is the most crucial of all.

FRONT-END LAYOUT : In this module we have to decide the logical layout of the project, that is, the various forms that we can jump to from one give form and their content. This software is not based on intranet; therefore as such there is no pre-determined structure of the software. This module involves designing user interfaces. Various points such as ease of use for the user, aesthetic look, color scheme, font sizes, appropriate help and error messages and sound error checks are included in this module.

DATA CAPTURING: Under this module we have to create various forms using which data can be entered and then stored in the database. Features such as Modification of data colleted, changing status of registered, viewing summary of the registration activities, printer friendly views and also examination of data will also be provided.

REPORT GENERATION: Under this module various types of reports are generated whose formats are predefined.            

Project Characteristics : 
Functionality: Easy to use & aesthetically pleasing Interface.
Platform Independent: The software has been designed using NetBeans IDE Technology with SQLiteStudio which makes it platform independent.
Scalability: The queries used to access the database are designed in such a way that the back- end can be easily shifted from one type of database to another without modifying the code at all. Reliability: All measures are taken to prevent the internal server error message from showing
Security: loosely coupled and changes in one do not affect the other. Users are allowed to enter into the system using his username and password.

Software Requirement:
The "Hospital Management System" would be developed to overcome the problems faced by the college in maintaining the Hospital which comes under the college. For this there are mainly following software requirements:
   1. NetBeanse IDE (JAVA)
   2. Window Xp or later Windows OS
   3. SQLiteStudio

 Hardware Requirement
The Hardware requirement of this project is given below: 
   Minimum 384 MB RAM.
   Colour Monitor with a screen resolution of at least 1024x768 pixels.
   Minimum Intel Pentium III workstation or equivalent 500 Mhz.
   Printer for printing report
